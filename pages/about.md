  ##   I have been coding since the summer of 1986, when I put my dirt bike into
  a tree and broke my leg.

  While everyone I knew was tapping kegs down at the beach, I was in my room tapping away on a second-gen TRS-80 Color Computer with a new copy of Color BASIC. I have been writing code ever since.



   I know, all coders have some version of this story, the moment they fell in love with conditional control structures or some such, but I sometimes wonder what would have happened had I not gotten up close and personal with that oak.



   So, I wound up at UGA for my BS in Computer Science, and then scooted over to Georgia Tech for their graduate program. My passion for coding continued to grow. In less than four years from that first day in June 1986, I had crossed the 10,000 hour mark.



   I started with San Francisco I.T. Engineers on day-one back in 2015. They billed themselves as “engineers on Demand” and I was so pumped about the concept that I signed on as CTO for free. As part of my employment package, I received a one-page “job description and responsibilities” sheet. It had three words printed upon it: Build amazing things.



  I am still trying to do that.
