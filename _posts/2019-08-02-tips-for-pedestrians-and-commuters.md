Hello, friend. Welcome to our fair City. Here, have a hoodie; you're going to need it. Now, while I have you here, can we talk about walking for a minute? 

Look, I know you've been perambulating for most of your life, and I know you think you are perfectly competent in so doing. Just hear me out. 

Multiple times a day, the person or group walking directly ahead of me on a crowded street will unexpectedly stop dead and cause the pedestrian equivalent of a 10 car pile-up. It happens on the stairs down into the Metro, in the doorways of buildings, nearly everywhere: “_I think I’ll just stop here_.” These are the same people who try to get **_onto_** the train before anyone has gotten **_off_** the train.

I am also a big fan of the groups of three or four who choose to walk abreast on a crowded city street, so that they become a sort of rolling roadblock that is impossible to get around. They are cousins to the folk who randomly weave left and right, to and fro, as they walk. Some of them, the elite I suppose, throw in a change up in velocity as well. Just try getting around one of _those_ badasses.  

So, a few tips then, hey?

◈ Walk as briskly as is comfortable for you. There are a ton of people all around you and they are all trying to get to somewhere. 

◈ If you want to gawk at something, and there frankly is a lot to gawk at, do not stop in the middle of the sidewalk. Just pick a spot on the curb side where you are not in anyone’s way and gawk away.

◈ Maintain a relatively constant speed and direction. It is no fun trying to guess what the lunatic stumbling along in front of you is going to do.

◈ Do not, and I can not overstate this, just suddenly **_stop_**. You would not just lock up your brakes in traffic; this is pretty much the same thing. Don’t do it. Use common sense.

◈ This one sounds ultra pedantic, but I would not be mentioning it if it didn’t happen all the bloody time: Let the people on the subway get off the car before you attempt to barge in. They get off and then you get on – see how that works?

Oh, last thing? Look down from time to time and watch where you are walking. You’ll thank me for that one in this city, believe me.

Cool. Now, off you go. Here, have some legal weed to go with your new hoodie.
