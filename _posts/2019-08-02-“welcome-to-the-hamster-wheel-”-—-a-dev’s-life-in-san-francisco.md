  High five, tech bro! You’ve made it. You live and work in the City. You
  grossed $180K last year, and this year looks even better. So, why are you
  looking for a way out?

_**“Eat >> Sleep >> Code >> Repeat“**_



More than just a meme, that is my life in synopsis. I am “_at work_” 24/7 just to stay afloat. In my spare time, I work on eLance or deliver food for one of my favorite startups. If I am not sleeping, I am earning. It has to be that way and this is why.



I write code for a living. I am lucky enough to do that in the Mecca of All Things Tech. I am one of the very few who work here and live here. As of the last official, Federal filing in April, I am solidly in the 28% bracket, right in the middle. So, I must be pretty comfortable, yes? Well, you’d think that, wouldn’t you?



Well, it is a bit more complex than that. For me, f2016 was \~ $180k gross. Remove $39.2k for Uncle Sammy, and Our Hero gets to keep \~$140k. California takes an additional $13,833 for state income tax, leaving \~ $126k. Social Security steals an additional $7,886, and Medicare $2,610 more. Now I have \~ $115k. My mandated health insurance is another $4k per annum, leaving only $111k, and I have an 8.75% tax on everything I buy, which is then partially deductible.



So, $180k becomes $111k instantly, with a penalty of almost 9 points whenever I put money back into the enterprise. My payroll is about $40k for things I need to outsource, leaving about $71k. Rent on my perfectly located, shoebox apartment/office is an additional $32k, AWS and Azure infrastructure costs about $2k, transportation is around $4k more (like most San Franciscans, I do not own a car), and I spend at least $20k a year on non-deductible logistics. That leaves $13k, or about $1,100 a month in disposable income. Yep, that is $275 a week, or $6.85/hr for a putative 40 hour workweek. Oh, would that I could work 40 hours. It is not particularly unusual for me to work 40 hours in two days on an urgent project. When you plug in how many hours I log, that hourly rate drops to around the 1978 minimum wage of $2.65.



Disposable income is what I want to focus on here because it is a pretty clear indicator of quality of life. Look, I make what most people consider to be a shit ton of money. It sure looks impressive on paper or in a screen cap, but when all is said and done, very little of that treasure winds up in my pockets. It is ridiculously expensive to do business in SF. My COA would make you piss your pants, and for those clients who do not want to pay for services in a timely manner; I’m looking at you, every medical practice ever; our shitty San Francisco municipal government grumpily makes it de facto impossible to collect a debt. When my past-90 collectables portfolio finally get past $100k, maybe I can throw a party for the Supervisors who claim administer this city. Twats.



I know this will strike a bitter tone with a lot of readers. I am, after all, living my paltry little dream. Who am I to complain that it is not quite as sweet as I expected? Fair enough, friends. I am just passing on the information. This is a frustrating market, where the good fail, the better tread water, and only the best make any real money.



Last Thursday, I had to fill in one of those stupid forms that I get from new clients from time to time. “Get to know you” type thing, this has spread like a virus in the City. Everyone has a fancier form now, and most are displayed on iPads. So, there is usually a few question about hobbies, interests and, my personal favorite, the eternal question: what \[X] people, real or fictional, living or dead, would you invite to a dinner party, and why? This was my answer.

> Just one man, and because your initial conditions permit it, Sisyphus. So many questions! Sissy, you have to know when you get out of bed in the morning, that the fucking rock is going to roll back down the fucking hill, yet fucking again. Still, you make a coffee or whatever a king of Ephyra drinks, and off you go to push that rock. Why? You do have a choice. That was built in to your torment. So, why? Is it ambition? Hope? Sheer bloody-mindedness? Does it feel good to get that rock to the top each time, even knowing it will only last a moment? Have you come to live for that? Do you look at those who are not engaged in the all consuming immediate task at hand and see sleepwalkers?
