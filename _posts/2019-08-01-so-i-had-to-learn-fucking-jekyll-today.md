   That's why this blog exists. I have a perfectly serviceable WordPress CMS that I have been using for yonks, but I need to learn yet another damn framework today, so I spun this thing up.

```
$ bundle exec jekyll _3.3.0_ new  myShittyNewBlog
```

There are too many goddamned [static site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page) generators. Just like JavaScript frameworks, the things are breeding like mad and will soon take over the planet. Think I'm kidding? Here is a partial list of the ones I know of, off the top of my head:

1. Jekyll
2. Next.js
3. Hugo
4. Gatsby
5. Hexo
6. VuePres
7. Middleman
8. Gridsome

\---

There are actually a [lot more](https://www.staticgen.com/) of them. Look, they are all just slightly different ways of doing the exact same thing, but because they all have their own syntactical quirks and conventions, there is an attention cost in learning each in turn. Worse, some are based on Ruby, some JavaScript, Python, etc; so there are dependencies to consider, as well as local development environments to be installed. Madness! Madness, I tell you!

So, why not pick one and be done with it? Because I do not get to pick; that's why. The client always dictates the specs, even when the specs are wrong. If I get tasked with building a first person shooter in Python or a snappy chat app in Unity, well of course its going to be shite, but I have to make it the best pile of shite it can be. 

Usually it is because a client has a competitor who uses Hugo or Gatsby, and they feel that they have too as well. Sometimes it is because they want to stay with the same language their main app is written in. Other times it is just because the project manager recently read about the newest flavor of the month on Fast Company.
