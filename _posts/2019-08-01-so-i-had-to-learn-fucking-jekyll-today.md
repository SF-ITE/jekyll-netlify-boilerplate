     That's why this blog exists. I have a perfectly serviceable WordPress CMS that I have been using for yonks, but I need to learn yet another damn framework today, so I spun this thing up. 

  ```
  $ bundle exec jekyll _3.3.0_ new  myShittyNewBlog
  ```

There are too many goddamned [static site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page) generators. Just like JavaScript frameworks, the things are breeding like mad and will soon take over the planet. Think I'm kidding? Here is a partial list of the ones I know of, off the top of my head:

1. Jekyll
2. Next.js
3. Hugo
4. Gatsby
5. Hexo
6. VuePres
7. Middleman
8. Gridsome

There are actually a [lot more](https://www.staticgen.com/) of them. Look, they are all just slightly different ways of doing the exact same thing, but because they all have their own snytactical quirks and conventions, there is an attention cost in learning each in turn. Worse, some are based on Ruby, some JavaScript, Python, etc; so there are dependencies to consider, as well as local development environments to be installed.
